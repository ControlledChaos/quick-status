## Status gives users a way to quickly create an update, post an image, add a video or share a link in WordPress – just like Facebook and Google+.

 

![Status updates make it easy to stay engaged with your site.](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dashboad-735x470.jpg)

 Status updates make it easy to stay engaged with your site.

### From the Front to the Back

Embed the status updater into every page on your site or strategically place it using the built-in widget. Give all your users a convenient front-end post tool or simply post from the WordPress dashboard. 

### Simple and Organized

Configure all of your status updates to use categories for convenient management and a more robust site search. It's simple posting for those that don't always have the time to write long form content.  Stay active and keep users engaged with smaller posts and interesting shares.  

![Customize the title, description and select your favorite thumbnail.](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/description-735x470.jpg)

 Customize the title, description and select your favorite thumbnail.

### Share Content

Share a news story, an interesting photo you found, a video you put together or just tell the world what you're thinking. Autofill pulls in a title, description and thumbnail and gives you complete freedom to edit them as you please.
